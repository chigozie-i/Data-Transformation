##TRANSFORM DATA WITH POWER QUERY EDITOR:

After importing data into your Power BI model, a glance at it within Power BI Desktop reveals a disorganized state: certain data is irrelevant, while essential data is improperly formatted. To rectify this, leveraging Power Query Editor becomes imperative to cleanse and structure the dataset before proceeding with report creation.

To ensure trustworthy and dependable analytics, data necessitates thorough cleansing and preparation. Power Query Editor, integrated into Power BI Desktop, serves as the catalyst for transforming your imported data. With dedicated features geared towards data cleansing and preparation, Power Query equips you with the tools needed for effective analysis. In this article, we'll lead you through a comprehensive, step-by-step guide on shaping your data.  
  
Accessing Power Query Editor is straightforward: simply navigate to the Transform Data option located on the Home tab of Power BI Desktop.

## STEPS TO SHAPING YOUR DATA:
**Step I:**  
### Columns and Headers  
1. Identify Column Headers and Names

The initial stage of shaping your data involves identifying the column headers and names within the dataset, followed by evaluating their positioning to confirm their correctness.  

![ETL IMG 3](https://github.com/chigozie-i/Data-Transformation/blob/main/ETL%20IMG%203.png)  
The data depicted in the image did not import as anticipated. Upon locating the column headers and names, adjustments can be made to restructure the data accordingly.  

2. Promote headers

To promote headers, you select the "Use First Row as Headers" option on the Home tab.

3. Rename columns

The next step in refining your data involves inspecting the column headers. You may uncover instances where one or more columns possess incorrect headers, there are spelling errors in headers, or the header naming convention lacks consistency or user-friendliness.

There are two methods to rename column headers. One method involves right-clicking the header, selecting "Rename," editing the name, and then pressing Enter. Alternatively, you can double-click the column header and directly overwrite the name with the correct one.  

4. Remove top rows

During the process of shaping your data, it may become necessary to eliminate certain top rows. This could be due to various reasons such as blank rows or containing data irrelevant to your reports.

To eliminate these surplus rows, navigate to the Home tab and choose "Remove Rows" then "Remove Top Rows".

5. Remove columns:

An essential aspect of the data shaping process involves eliminating redundant columns. It's preferable to discard columns at the earliest stage feasible. One approach to achieving this is by restricting the columns during the data retrieval process from the data source.

There are two methods to remove columns. The initial method entails selecting the desired columns for removal, then navigating to the Home tab and selecting "Remove Columns.".  

![ETL IMG 8](https://github.com/chigozie-i/Data-Transformation/blob/main/ETL%20IMG%208.png)  

Alternatively, you have the option to choose the columns you wish to retain and then, on the Home tab, select "Remove Columns" then "Remove Other Columns."  

6. Unpivot columns:

Unpivoting proves to be a valuable feature within Power BI, applicable across various data sources. However, it finds frequent use particularly when importing data from Excel.

Consider the sample Excel document containing sales data below:

![ETL IMG 9](https://github.com/chigozie-i/Data-Transformation/blob/main/ETL%20IMG%209.png)  

Generating a comprehensive total of all sales spanning 2018 and 2019 would pose a challenge. To facilitate the creation of total sales within Power BI, these three columns are required: Month, Year, and SalesAmount.  
  
Upon importing the data into Power Query, it will resemble the following image:

![ETL IMG 10](https://github.com/chigozie-i/Data-Transformation/blob/main/ETL%20IMG%2010.png)  

Following that, rename the initial column to "Month." Proceed by selecting the 2018 and 2019 columns, then navigate to the Transform tab within Power Query, and choose the "Unpivot" option.  

![ETL IMG 11](https://github.com/chigozie-i/Data-Transformation/blob/main/ETL%20IMG%2011.png)  

The outcome:  

![ETL IMG 12](https://github.com/chigozie-i/Data-Transformation/blob/main/ETL%20IMG%2012.png)  


You can rename the Attribute column to Year and the Value column to SalesAmount.
